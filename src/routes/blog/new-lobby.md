The Team SMP's lobby boasts an iconic design that has captured the hearts of our community. Recently, we embarked on an exciting journey to reimagine and rebuild our beloved lobby. But before we delve into the details of this groundbreaking project, let's take a nostalgic trip through the annals of history.

## The Inception of Our Journey: The First Lobby

Our journey began with a humble start - the Team SMP's inaugural lobby. A simplistic structure, it comprised a modest, cuboid-shaped building crafted from pristine quartz, crowned with a transparent glass roof. Within its confines lay an Overworld portal beckoning adventurers forward into the vast expanse of the Arena. While functional, it lacked the charm and vibrancy we yearned for, prompting us to embark on a quest for something greater. (Fun fact: It was originally built by JunglTemple!)

## Evolving Excellence: The Improved Lobby

Enter the next chapter of our saga - a realm of heightened excitement and innovation. Perched atop a floating island of rugged stone, our improved lobby stood as a beacon of progress. At its core stood the Lobby Building, a magnificent structure fashioned from a harmonious blend of azure concrete powder and gleaming quartz. Emblazoned upon its fa√ßade in bold, block letters was the illustrious moniker "TEAM SMP." However, fate had other plans in store for us...

## A Renaissance Unveiled: The Magnificent New Lobby

Behold the dawn of a new era - the grand unveiling of our latest masterpiece. Prepare to be enchanted by its splendor! Our new lobby is a marvel to behold, boasting a captivating design that evokes the charm of Italian villages. Picture-perfect streets lined with quaint houses converge at a bustling town square, adorned with shops offering ranks and essential items. Each thoroughfare culminates in a portal, offering passage to different realms of our server. With intricate details and captivating aesthetics, this is undeniably our most ambitious project yet. Mark your calendars for the grand debut on April 5th, 2024!

### The Addition of NPC Residents

But wait, there's more! For the first time in the history of Team SMP, our new lobby will be graced by the presence of non-player characters (NPCs). These virtual denizens will breathe life into our bustling village, adding depth and immersion to the player experience. From merchants peddling wares to friendly townsfolk offering quests and lore, the introduction of NPCs marks a significant milestone in our server's evolution. Prepare to interact with these digital inhabitants and uncover the secrets they hold. Truly, the possibilities are endless in our vibrant new lobby.
