The Team SMP's lobby has an iconic design, and we've recently started work on a new one. Before we talk about that, though, we'll take you on a ride through history.

## The First Lobby
The Team SMP's first lobby was very simple: an empty, quartz, cuboid-shaped building with a glass roof and an Overworld portal, a doorway leading forward into the Arena, which had seats and another huge, empty space. But this was a _bit_ boring, to say the least, so we started building a new one. (The reason for that was that it was built by JunglTemple)

## The Reimagined Lobby
The next iteration of our lobby was a lot more exciting. It was on a stone floating island, but the most important and the most recognisable part was the Lobby Building. The building was made of blue concrete powder (although there were some arguments about the colour) and quartz. It had the text "TEAM SMP" in block letters on the front face.
